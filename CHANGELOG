A list of user-facing changes since the latest Shadow release.

* Added latency modeling and potential thread-yield to rdtsc emulation,
  allowing managed code to avoid deadlock in busy-loops that use only the rdtsc
  instruction and no syscalls. https://github.com/shadow/shadow/pull/2314
* The build now internally uses `pkg-config` to locate glib, instead of a custom cmake module.
  This is the [recommended](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/compiling.html) way of
  getting the appropriate glib compile flags, and works better in non-standard layouts such
  as in a [guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) environment.
* The `setup` script now has a `--search` option, which can be used to add additional directories
  to search for pkg-config files, C headers, and libraries. It obsoletes the options `--library` and `--include`.
* Fixed a bug causing `mmap` to fail when called on a file descriptor that was
opened with `O_NOFOLLOW`. https://github.com/shadow/shadow/pull/2353
* Bare executable names are now resolved by searching shadow's `PATH`. Previously these were
interpreted as relative to the current directory. For backwards compatibility, Shadow will currently
prefer a binary in that location if one is found but log a warning. Such cases should be disambiguated
by using an absolute path or prefixing with `./`.
